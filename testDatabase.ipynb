We observe more frequent and intense hurricanes, such as Hurricane Harvey in 2017, which caused widespread flooding and devastating impacts. Additionally, heatwaves are becoming more common, as seen in the European heatwave of 2019. These events are clear indicators of the changing climate. Agriculture is heavily affected, with altered precipitation patterns, shifting growing seasons, and increased pest pressure. These changes threaten food security globally, impacting crop yields and quality. To address this, individuals can contribute by adopting sustainable practices, such as reducing meat consumption, using energy-efficient appliances, and supporting renewable energy sources. These efforts collectively help reduce the overall carbon footprint and contribute to mitigating climate change.\"]\n",
